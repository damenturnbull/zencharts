## Run

The repo includes a small nodejs server for use locally. The server uses the 'connect' and 'serve-static' node modules.

## Highcharts

#### Mock Reports

Mock reports are loading by default. These reports use mock data based on Highcharts templates.

#### Live Reports

Live reports replace the default graph data with data from a Zendesk endpoint. 

**In order to run Live reports the user must have access to a zendesk subdomain eg. https://{subdomain}.zendesk.com**

To run Live Reports:

1. Clicking on "Live Reports" will redirect you to the a Zendesk subdomain login page.
2. Login using credentials for your particular domain.
3. You will be redirected back to the zencharts and the Mock data will be replaced with the Live data.

For example, when 'Live Reports' is successful, the 'Customer Access' pie charts will be updated with data for Zendesk "end users".

GET /api/v2/users/search.json?role=end-user

## OAuth and Zendesk

Due to Same Origin Policy it is not possible to send requests to Zendesk API endpoints with Ajax alone. Instead, this application uses Cross Origin Resouce Sharing (CORS) with the OAuth protocol.

The OAuth protocol authenticates all requests to the Zendesk API and allows ansychronous requests to API endpoints.
