# zencharts

Zencharts uses the High Charts graphing library. Zencharts also demonstrates how to connect to the Zendesk Developer API using JavaScript and the OAuth protocol.

Zencharts is not a real company...

## Run

The repo includes a small nodejs server local use. 

#### 
    $ node server.js

Browser access via http://127.0.0.1:8080/

## Highcharts

#### Mock Reports

The Highcharts reports are built with mock data by default.

#### Live Reports

Live reports replace the default graph data with data from a Zendesk API endpoint. 

**In order to run Live reports the user must have access to the test Zendesk subdomain.** ie. https://fando.zendesk.com

To run Live Reports:

1. Clicking on "Live Reports" will redirect you to the a Zendesk subdomain login page.
2. Login using credentials for your particular domain. (not publicly provided)
3. You will be redirected back to the zencharts and the mock data will be replaced with the live data.

For example, when 'Live Reports' is successful, the 'Customer Access' pie chart will be updated using data from Zendesk "end users".

GET /api/v2/users/search.json?role=end-user

## OAuth and Zendesk

Due to Same Origin Policy it is not possible to send requests to Zendesk API endpoints with client side JavaScript alone. Instead, this application uses Cross Origin Resouce Sharing (CORS) with the OAuth protocol to achieve access.

http://oauth.net/

The OAuth protocol authenticates all requests to the Zendesk API and allows ansychronous requests to API endpoints.

## Original Specification

#### _Beautifully Simple Report_

_Pretend you run an eCommerce website and use Zendesk for your customer service.
You have customers who log-in to your store and then purchase clothes. 
As a business owner youâ€™d like to know more about your customers and the way they interact with your business._

_Use a publicly available charting library to show:_

_- What percentage of customers have logged in recently._
_- How many customers have contacted support over the past 15 days._
_- Who the best support agents are in your company (based off how many tickets they solved)_

_Your priority is code clarity and maintainability._

_Bonus points:_

_- Hook the reporting up to the Zendesk API (https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/core/introduction)._


## Testing

Zencharts is tested with Karma and Jasmine.

#### 
    $ karma start
